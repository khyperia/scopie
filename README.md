Please note that this code is hardware-specific (to the hardware that khyperia has in her setup). As such, it's not exactly intended for use outside of a personal project - but if you find a use for it, fantastic! :)

My hardware:

* The [QHY163M](https://www.qhyccd.com/QHY163.html) (primary) and the [QHY5L-II-M](https://www.qhyccd.com/QHY5L-II.html) (guider). Software in this repo is generic to all QHY cameras.
* Skywatcher NEQ6 Pro. Software in this repo is generic to all synscan telescopes.

The `qhyccd` folder is from [their website](https://www.qhyccd.com/SDK.html). I have included them in this repo to simplify the build process. There doesn't seem to be a license associated with it, otherwise I would include it in this repo.

This repo is under the MIT license.
