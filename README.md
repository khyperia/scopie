Please note that this code is hardware-specific (to the hardware that khyperia has in her setup). As such, it's not exactly intended for use outside of a personal project - but if you find a use for it, fantastic! :)

My hardware:

* A QHY163M (primary) and a QHY5L-II-M (guider). This repo is generic to all QHY cameras.
* Skywatcher NEQ6 Pro. This repo is generic to all synscan telescopes.
